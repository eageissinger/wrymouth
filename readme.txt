Subject: Stable isotope (d13C and d15N) and feeding preference of wrymouth (<i>Cryptacanthodes maculatus</i>) in eastern Maine, USA.

Data collected by: Emilie A. Geissinger, Brian F. Beal, and William G. Ambrose, Jr. Assistance was provided by Cody Jourdet (Downeast Institute) 
and Dr. Beverely Johnson and Phil Dostie (Bates College).

Background: Two intertidal mudflates in eastern Maine (Washington County) were sampled in this study: Larrabee Cove in Machiasport and 
Mud Hole Cove on Great Was Island, Beals. Wrymouth and potential prey were sampled in both mudflats in the spring and summer of 2013. 
Wrymouth were collected by walking on and around burrows to collapse them. Fish were collected when they surfaced (after 10-15 minutes), 
and immediately paralyzed in 1.0 g of Tricane-S dissolved in 1.0 liter of seawater (collection method approved by the Institutional Animal 
Care and Use Committee [IACUC] at University of Maine, Orono; Beal et al. 2016). Specimens were depurated for 24-48 hours and then stored 
at -10°C. Samples were freeze-dried prior to isotopic analysis. Algal tissue, muscle tissue from large animals, and the entire soft tissue 
of small animals were analyzed. Tissue samples weighed between 0.4-0.6 mg, and algal samples between 2.0-2.5 mg. Stable isotope analyses was 
performed using a Delta V stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS) (Costech Elemental Analyzer Model 4010) in the Environmental Geochemistry 
Laboratory, Bates College, in Lewiston, Maine.  Stable isotopes were expressed in the δ notation.Individual wrymouth were weighed to the nearest 0.1 g, 
and total length measured to the nearest 0.5 cm. Full and empty stomachs were weighed, and the difference was used to calculate the mass of gut contents. 
Contents were observed under a stereoscopic microscope at 30x and individuals classified to the lowest possible taxonomic level and recorded as present, 
following methods of Beal et al. (2016). Statistical analysis was conducted in R.

title: d13C and d15N values of all species collected (see species_list.csv)
file name: wry_isotope_full.csv
date of data collection: samples were analyzed from November 2013 to March 2014.
method of data collection: Tissue samples weighed between 0.4-0.6 mg, and algal samples between 2.0-2.5 mg. Stable isotope analyses was performed using a 
Delta V stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS) (Costech Elemental Analyzer Model 4010) in the Environmental Geochemistry Laboratory, Bates College, 
in Lewiston, Maine.  Stable isotopes were expressed in the δ notation according to the following definition:
δX(‰)=[(R_SAMPLE/R_STANDARD )-1]× 10^3, 	[Equation 1]
where X is 13C or 15N, R is 13C:12C or 15N:14N, and the standards were Vienna pee dee belemnite (VPDB) and air for carbon and nitrogen, respectively. 
Accuracy and precision of the IRMS was determined by multiple analyses of working standards (acetanilide, cod meat, and caffeine), run at the beginning, 
middle, and end of every 40 samples.
